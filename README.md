# Reddit Image Clip Downloader
Downloads images and clips from the top entries of subreddits/mutireddits and stores them in an AES encrypted file.

## Features

Only download image files and mp4 + webm files. No youtube/other streaming site support.

This saves trouble from going into the subreddit and having the subreddit post URLs as port of the browsing history.
